Payment Systems in Healthcare,"The admonition Â¿Follow the moneyÂ¿ is good advice to anyone seeking a deeper understanding of any health care system. Money is a major tool for shaping the delivery of health care, for both good and ill. This course will follow the money as it flows through provider payment systems, and examine the effects of these flows on those who give, receive and pay for health care. Topics will include current payment methods for hospital care and physicians as well as innovative payment strategies and models under development. Cross-national examples will be used occasionally to gain greater understanding of some of the challenges that face all health care systems in designing successful provider payment systems. Guest speakers will provide a first-hand perspective on selected topics. Registration Note: Priority goes to HPM-SM2, and MPH45-HP students"

Students will work on their papers independently, under the overall supervision of their own faculty advisors. Each student will critique the papers of classmates. The instructor will guide the discussion and use the paper to make additional points of constructive criticism, which will serve to illustrate the principles enunciated at the beginning of the class. Guidelines for journals and co-author criteria will be discussed. Approach to revisions based on reviewers' comments will be covered. Course Location: Building 2 Room 375"
The Law and Clinical Medicine,"This course will examine what impact health policy and law has on the quality of health care. The course will examine the legal system's evaulation and treatment of quality and safety of health care and how it has--or has not--inspired change and innovation within the medical profession. Topics will include: medical malpractice law, new programs created by the Accountable Care Act, and new innovations from within the clinical profession. In addition, students will analyze and interpret some legal dilemmas created by new developments in medical care that can outpace the laws. Students will have the opportunity to describe challenges in the delivery of high quality care, examine why they occur, and formulate policy approaches that might solve them. Registration Note: Priority goes to MPH45-HP students"
Study Designs For EPI,"This course reviews the main study designs currently used to describe, predict, and investigate the causes of adverse health outcomes in humans. We will examine general principles, interpretation, strengths, and limitations of the study designs that are commonly used for population research. The course covers ecological, cross-sectional, cohort, case-control, and case-only designs in a number of different settings. Issues related to study population identification, exposure and disease definition and ascertainment, misclassification, confounding, and generalizability are considered in the light of typically available data sources. Idiosyncrasies of several fields, from infectious disease to occupational epidemiology, and their relevance to the selection of an optimal study design are discussed. This course fulfills a core course requirement for the MPH in Epidemiology. Pre-requisites: ID200 and EPI522"
Reducing Socio Racial Inequal,"This course will provide a critical overview of conceptual approaches and empirical evidence for interventions that take a social determinants approach to reduce socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in health status. The focus is on the extent to which policies and interventions on the social determinants of health can both improve health and reduce disparities. It considers interventions within the healthcare system, but emphasis is given to population-based interventions within the healthcare system, but emphasis is given to population-based interventions on the social determinants of health in multiple other societal sectors. Attention is also given to the social and political barriers to the development and proliferation of effective intervention to address social disparities in health. The course is designed as a three-hour session that combines a lecture format in the first half of the class with a seminar-style format in the second half during which students will lead the discussion on a pre-assigned reading with regards to evidence for an intervention on specific social conditions or conceptual, methodological, logistical or political challenges related to the development and/or implementation of successful interventions. The seminar component is designed to allow a free interchange of ideas among all students. It is expected that the classroom environment will be utilized to share expertise, vigorously challenge conventional wisdom that does not have a scientific foundation, and develop testable hypotheses that might guide future research and rigorous evaluation of interventions. Course Prerequisite(s): (SBS201 or SBS 254 or SBS207) and (EPI201&amp;202 or EPI500 or ID201)"

ENGLISH 90AL: Anthropocene Literature,"In 2000, geologists proposed that we live in a new geological era defined and shaped by human activity: the Anthropocene.&nbsp; In this course, we will consider how living in the Anthropocene demands that we think about ourselves not just as individuals and citizens of a nation, but also as members of a species that exercises geological forces upon the physical conditions of our planet.&nbsp; Readings will span from the eighteenth century to the present.&nbsp; We will consider questions such as: What kinds of narrative and aesthetic forms can represent environmental changes that take place on vast geographic and temporal scales? What sort of ethics does living in the Anthropocene warrant and inspire? How can we talk about the relationship of ethics and aesthetics to the economic and political challenges of the Anthropocene? We will explore these questions while attending to the conceptual and rhetorical strategies through which nature and the environment have been portrayed in works by Montesquieu, Wordsworth, John Clare, Mary Shelley, John Stuart Mill, Thoreau, Darwin, John Muir, Rachel Carson, Cormac McCarthy, Ursula Le Guin, and Karen Russell."
CELLBIO 302QC: Advanced Experimental Design for Biologists,"This course will focus on both the theory and practice of experimental design.

Course Activities: Lectures and structured workshops in the instructional computer facility. Course Note: Basic biostatistics and a course in regression analysis recommended."
"SPANSH 144: Poetry, Art and Adversity","The objective of this course is to understand the history of poetry as the history of adversity. That is, we will consider poetry as the history of the distance mediated between the work of art and the utopian concept that grounds artistic creation, namely, to make of life itself the greatest work of art. With this dual condition in mind, we will begin by considering emblematic works of Latin American poetry, including Trilce by César Vallejo, Altazor by Vicente Huidobro, Poema conjectural&nbsp; by Jorge Luis Borges, Alturas de Macchu Picchu by Pablo Neruda, and then move to more performative works, such as Nicanor Parra’s antipoetry, Alfredo Jaar’s installations and the art actions of CADA. If the history of poetry and art in general is the history of adversity, the history of adversity is also the history of our dreams."

ANTHRO 2674: Legal Anthropology and Modern Governance,"This course examines changing configurations of law, power and governance. The law, and in particular the ‘rule of law’ has been central to imagining and delineating the relationship between the political and the legal. In particular it is the means through which sovereign power has been conceptualized and limited. This subsumption of the political to the legal has been critiqued by Schmitt and the reduction of power to law has been challenged by Foucault. We begin by exploring these theoretical challenges to liberal legality before turning to the relationship between law and imperialism.&nbsp; In subsequent weeks we continue exploring these themes of legal regulation, emergency, exception, rights and violence through contemporary ethnographies."

Topics include cognitive and behavioral differences between men and women and male and female reproductive strategies. Examples are drawn primarily from traditional and modern human societies; data from studies of nonhuman primates are also considered."
ECON 2490: The Economics of National Security Seminar,"Considers a range of issues relating to national security, including bioterrorism, the market for nuclear weapons, the defense industry, the dependence on imported oil, intelligence, sanctions, etc."
The Impact of Buildings,"It is well-known and oft-repeated in environmental health circles that we spend 90% of time indoors. Because this constitutes the vast majority of our exposure time, and concentrations of many indoor pollutants are actually higher indoors than outdoors, it follows logically that indoor environments influence our health. Buildings have the potential for both positive and negative impacts on this indoor exposure, and can mitigate the burden of outdoor pollutants indoors. Over 40 years of research on the indoor environment has yielded many insights into building-related factors that influence health, well-being, and productivity. To meet challenges related to energy and materials, while simultaneously providing healthy indoor environments, buildings must incorporate sustainability criteria into every aspect of design, construction and operation. By definition, green buildings focus on minimizing impacts to the environment through reductions in energy usage, water usage, and minimizing environmental disturbances from the building site. Also by definition, but perhaps less widely recognized, green buildings aim to improve human health through design of healthy indoor environments. This class will cover basic principles of high performance building design, construction and operation, and impacts on indoor environmental quality, including chemical exposures, light, noise and thermal comfort. One class each week will be dedicated to lectures on these topics, with case studies and experiences from building practitioners that have successfully incorporated sustainability features in historic and contemporary structures. We will also have guests from across the university (Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Graduate School of Design, Harvard Medical School, Harvard University Office of Sustainability). The concepts presented in lectures will be reinforced in the second class each week with field trips, advanced modeling seminars and hands-on measurements of indoor environmental parameters. This course will be a requirement for the planned MPH65 degree track program in Sustainability and Environmental Management."
STAT 123: Applied Quantitative Finance,"Introduction to financial derivatives and the probabilistic techniques used to analyze them. Topics include: forwards, swaps and options; replication, no-arbitrage and risk-neutrality; martingales, numeraires and the fundamental theorem of asset pricing; and an introduction to interest-rate derivatives and their valuation. Provides a rigorous but accessible treatment of the elegant theory underpinning quantitative finance, motivated by real problems from the financial industry."
Econometric Methods in Impact Evaluation,"The objective of this course is to provide students with a set of theoretical, econometric and reasoning skills to estimate the causal impact of one variable on another. Examples from the readings explore the causal effect of policies, laws, programs and natural experiments derived from pension programs to television shows to natural disasters. We will go beyond estimating causal effects to analyze the channels through which the causal impact was likely achieved. This will require that the students are familiar with microeconomic theories of incentives, institutions, social networks, etc. The course will introduce students to a variety of econometric techniques in impact evaluation and a set of reasoning skills intended to help them become both a consumer and producer of applied empirical research. Students will learn to critically analyze evaluation research and to gauge how convincing the research is in identifying a causal impact. They will use these skills to develop an evaluation plan for a topic of their own, with the aim of stimulating ideas for dissertation research. This is a methods class that relies heavily on familiarity with econometrics and microeconomics. These are pre-requisites for the course without exception. The course is intended for doctoral students who are finishing their course work and aims to help them transition into independent research. The aim of this course is to prepare doctoral students in the health systems track of the Global Health and Population department for the dissertation phase of their research and thus they will be given priority in enrollment. The course is also open to other GHP doctoral students, other GHP masters students and students from other departments, conditional on having adequate training in economics and the course having enough space. Pre-Requisites: Econometrics and intermediate micro-economics are required for this course. While students can get by with just these two subjects, some previous experience with regression analysis and applied economic research will be a huge advantage. Students seeing applied regression analysis for the first time in this course will most likely struggle with the reading."
FOLKMYTH 176: Tattoo: Histories and Practices,"Tattooing has been practiced in many different social and cultural settings, in many different time periods, to different ends. In the United States, tattooing was long associated with marginalized and stigmatized groups, but since the 1970s, has become increasingly popular and even mainstream. This seminar style class will explore distinct regional histories of tattoo, the development of tattooing in the US, and the different ways that contemporary tattoo practitioners situate themselves historically and negotiate boundaries of race, class and gender. We will also consider tattoo as an art form that both invites and resists aesthetic judgments."
Enabling Change - Year 2,"Why are some individuals successful in enabling positive change in public health What applied skills do they have that allow them to create effective teams, organizations, and coalitions How do they address the unique field of public health, with its diffuse power structures and multitude of stakeholders The need for public health leadership is great, the challenges are manyâ  how does one learn to lead To be a successful applied public health practitioner individuals must go beyond traditional public health research skills and methodologies and learn how to enable positive change at four levels of application: within themselves, amongst their team, inside their organizations, and across systems. Students must also master practical competencies related to leadership, management, innovation, and communication. Students who address these competencies and apply them across each level of application will be the most ready to serve as public health leaders upon graduation. This course builds upon the Year 1 curriculum and supplements other required courses in the DrPH Enabling Change Curriculum. Each week, students will be guided through exercises that allow them to practice critical skills related to these competencies. Exercises and assignments will incorporate concepts covered in prior or concurrent coursework. This course will also prepare students for their field immersion and DELTA project experiences by providing frameworks for team building, consulting skills, and principles of professionalism. This course will prepare students to enter the workforce with the skills needed to understand complex organizational dynamics and influence positive change in those organizations. This course meets only on the Tuesdays below: 1/26 2/9 2/23 3/8 3/29 4/12 4/26 5/10"
ECON 1450R: Religion and Political Economy,"Recent research on religion has stressed social-science approaches. Parts of the work assess effects of economic and other forces on religious participation and beliefs. This topic includes models of secularization and of competition among alternative forms of religion, including analyses of the Reformation. Religious conversion and the club model of religious participation will be considered. Other aspects of the research analyze effects of religiosity on microeconomic variables, including work effort, thrift, education, health, and violence. Parts consider the impact of religion on macroeconomic outcomes, including economic growth. Additional work considers the interplay between religion and political institutions, including the role of state religion and interactions with Communism and democracy."
MBB 980N: Neuroaesthetics,"Focuses on neuroaesthetics, an emerging field offering a scientific perspective on the nature of art and the ways that art reveals human nature. Integrates findings from neuroscience, psychology, evolutionary biology, philosophy, and scholarship in the arts and humanities. Beings with a brief history of ideas on aesthetics, art, beauty, and pleasure. Considers the neural underpinnings of response to art in the brain's reward system and default network. Among the questions considered: Why are people drawn to art that is neither conventionally beautiful nor entirely pleasurable? Is art a vehicle for simulating experiences and understanding other minds? What does it mean to """"enjoy"""" sad music or chills and thrills in response to fiction or film? Can art promote well-being? The course will range across the arts but will focus on fiction, film, and music, and response to art rather than its creation."
"EMR 110: The EMR of Food: How Ethnicity, Migration, and Rights Are Parts of the Food We Eat","Everybody eats yet food varies widely across cultures and the implications of our food choices have rippling—and often disparate—affects across people groups.&nbsp; This course will examine how ethnicity, migration, and human rights are bound up in the American food system.&nbsp; Topics will include food as a carrier of culture, the relationship between agricultural practices and migrant labor, health and nutritional inequalities, and environmental impact."
Entrepreneurial Finance II,"Entrepreneurs create novel services, products, and organizations in the hopes of delivering value-both financial and social-to the world. Foundational to such work is an understanding of the language of finance and the process of developing new ventures, both of which are explained in the course that precedes this one, Entrepreneurial Finance I. As a result of work in that course, or in equivalent prerequisite activities, students enter Entrepreneurial Finance II with a fairly well developed idea and a robust financial plan. From this starting point, students in this course will take their ideas to the next stage of development by engaging in work """"outside the building"""" to refine their business model hypotheses and their financial assumptions. They also will learn in depth key financial concepts related to entrepreneurship, with a particular emphasis on the types of financing transactions that are needed to fund innovation and growth. By practicing the work entrepreneurs must do in early stages of launching a new organization, from """"customer development"""" to doing deals, students will aim to improve the ideas, strategies, tactics related to their plans and thereby increase the odds of success. This course will start with lecture and discussion sessions aimed at ensuring a shared understanding of key concepts and enabling productive work for the balance of the course. Next, students will develop and implement a """"customer discovery"""" plan to test key hypotheses in their business models and in their financial plans. Finally, the class will engage in a series of team-based exercises (games and simulations) that emphasize key steps in launching a venture: fundraising, managing the financial requirements of growth, and achieving scale (or exiting). These interactive sessions are designed to reveal key issues and challenges, so that students can reflect on lessons learned and embed those learnings into an enhance operating plan. The work of the course will be channeled into a private blog for each student / venture, where key deliverables, reflections, and lessons learned will be memorialized. With this blog as a running list of key learnings, students will then produce a final paper that explains learnings and related changes to business model and financial assumptions as a result of the coursework. Prerequisite:MLD-829M or permission of the instructor."
Advanced Intensive Writing: Analytical Writing for Policy Journals and Other Publications,"This intensive six-week module is designed to familiarize students with the process of writing, editing and publishing long-format articles in policy journals and magazines. Students will learn how to use persuasive, well-researched writing to influence policy debates and policymaking, bridging the gap between academic, public sector and general interest audiences. Through relevant readings, frequent writing assignments and exercises, along with peer and instructor feedback, students will complete this module with a polished persuasive article and strategies for publication. It is advisable, though not required, that students registering for DPI-840M have first completed DPI-810M, DPI-811M, DPI-820M, or DPI-821M, or a comparable writing course. Each course in the DPI communications series assumes fluency with the English language."
Social Change in the Digital Age,"This course will explore the role of digital technology in contemporary civic engagement and social movement organizing. Participation in social movements and civic engagement has become easier than even before. New """"digital native"""" movements showcase the possibilities of digital media to increase the possibilities for social change and civic renewal, though many such efforts fail to achieve their potential because of poor understanding of digital media applications. Course work includes an examination of the theories behind technology and social change as well as practical assessments of tactics at work online and offline today. Among the cases examined will be Common Cause, MoveOn.org, and #blacklivesmatter. Students will leave the class understanding both the """"how"""" and the """"why"""" of digital activism for issue advocacy and political campaigns."
Innovation Field Lab: Public Problem Solving in Massachusetts Cities,"The Innovation Field Lab provides a one-of-a-kind experiential learning environment for students, delivers tailor-made innovations to cities, and creates the opportunity for cutting-edge action research. City residents expect high quality services that represent value for taxpayer money and respond to pressing public problems. In order to meet these demands, city leaders must craft innovative programs and operations. However, in an era of constrained budgets, government rarely has the time, capacity or funds to develop and implement new ideas and tools. The Ash Center at HKS has partnered with Massachusetts cities to address this imbalance. The result is the Innovation Field Lab. In the first half of the course, students will familiarize themselves with the social and administrative realities in the cities they have been assigned to and learn to apply foundational frameworks of strategic innovation, collaborative governance, performance management and public leadership. In the second half, student teams will explore and address the city ?Ts challenges on location. Using concepts and skills learned in the course, as well as from other courses and prior experiences, students will help cities reinvent practice. Weekly class sessions will take place on campus. Additionally, city teams will meet once a week, either on campus or in their respective cities. The work will be demanding, but rewarding. Students should expect to be continually challenged: innovation in the real world requires creativity, patience, persistence, and teamwork that brings together political, technical, and analytical skills. This course is for students who are willing to go the extra mile and are comfortable with the inevitable uncertainty associated with making change. Dr. Jorrit de Jong (HKS Lecturer and Academic Director of the Innovations in Government Program) and Mayor Joseph Curtatone (Mayor of Somerville and Senior Fellow at HKS) will facilitate the on-campus sessions, while field lab coaches will be available to help coordinate the field work. This course will benefit from a balanced group of students whose skills and experiences will complement each other. Experience in municipal government, urban planning, community development, policy analysis, public-sector innovation, consulting, data-analytics, coding, and change management will enable students to excel in this course. Students with no experience in any of these areas should contact professor De Jong to determine if they are sufficiently prepared for this class. Recommended prior or companion courses include: DPI-312 (Moore and Bildner); SUP-601 (Mayne); MLD-620M (Goldsmith); MLD-332 (Gergen); MLD-602 (Behn), and MLD-101.

GOV 94ES: New European democracies: the 2016 Spanish democratic revolution in a comparative perspective,"This seminar aims to develop an in-depth understanding of modern Democracy’s discontent through the Spanish case study in a comparative perspective. In 40 years Spain has turned from being an exemplary model of transition to democracy to a leading example of disaffection with political and economic elites. The Indignados movement and two new political parties (Podemos and Ciudadanos) unexpectedly emerged and within two years have come to govern the&nbsp; largest cities (Barcelona, Madrid, and Valencia) and are becoming the most influential political parties in the most important regional governments (Andalucia, Madrid, and Valencia). Is this a model for democratic transformation in Europe? Can citizens really change traditional political party agendas or replace them?"

"Critical Race Theory: Issues of Race, Gender & Class","<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Enrollment is by-permission. Students should submit a statement of interest of no more than one page to Miriam Sopin-Vilme at msopinvilme@law.harvard.edu and Chanda Smart at csmart@law.harvard.edu.</p> <p><strong>Exam Type:</strong> None.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Professors Gerald Torres, Susan Sturm and Dayna Cunningham will co-teach this reading group.</p> <p>In the mid-1980s a scholarly movement developed in the legal academy challenging both the substance and style of traditional legal scholarship related to race: Critical Race Theory. This movement questioned the structure and assumptions of traditional civil rights litigation including the focus on individual rights as well as definitions of meritocracy and color-blind approaches to solving legal problems. Critical race scholars employed new methodologies for legal scholarship, including storytelling, combining legal and literary analysis, and post-modernism and post-structuralism.</p> <p>Insights from post-colonialism as well as the self-conscious use of qualitative analysis and first person accounts of racialized law and legal institutions helped distinguish this new school. Critical race theorists view racism as a reflection of historical and contemporary racialized policies that are embedded in legal, political, and cultural institutions. Race is the working out of this lived experience and that experience is part of the constitution of a racialized identity. CRT brings this insight to bear in analyzing law and legal institutions. CRT has had a troubled role in the academy because it not only cuts across many disciplines, but because it has combined scholarly inquiry with advocacy. Some of the members of this reading group may choose to explore its genesis and its continuing critical relevance. Critical race theory can then be useful in telling us about how to understand current social movements and the role that lawyers may play.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong>The first class meeting will be Monday, January 25th. The rest of the meeting dates are 2/8, 2/22, 3/7, 3/21, 4/4.</p>"

Design for the Just City,"<p>In “The Spirit Level: Why Greater Equality Makes Societies Stronger”, Dr. Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett present a compelling set of data illustrating that material inequality has a profound influence on population stratification, status insecurity and competition, and the prevalence of all the urban problems associated with chronic health and social conditions, as well as the strength of community life (Wilkinson and Pickett, 2009). The data reveals that the United States ranks the worst among other countries with the highest income inequality and the worst index of health and social problems.</p> <br /> <br /> <p>Similarly, when we examine the presence of urban justice in housing, transportation, commercial development and infrastructure, it might be fair to question whether there is more to do in creating a Just City, where the disciplines of city planning and design should be playing a more active role in policy making, participatory process design and innovative physical interventions that address both spatial and social justice issues. Imagine if we created a process and specific metrics for evaluating the performance of the city’s public spaces, housing developments, commercial districts or transportation systems for their impact of creating more urban justice?</p> <br /> <br /> <p>As designers, policy makers and creators of the built environment, we have the ability to produce outcome, process and engagement innovations that facilitate the Just City. This interactive seminar will investigate the roots and current conditions of injustice in cities, concepts of urban justice and the intentions of design movements to affect justice as a way to inform the production of student Just City manifestos, the development of metrics to assess how design can facilitate greater urban justice, and a participatory tool to assess the presence of justice and/or injustice in a local neighborhood.</p> <br /> <br /> <p>Course activities will include active course discussions, lectures, guest speakers, site visits, opinion essays, individual and collaborative research and analysis, and student presentations. Specific course outcomes include:</p> <br /> <br /> <p>1. Defining the “Just City” through digital collages, manifesto essays and short multi-media videos<br /> <br /> 2. Developing Just City metrics framework and participatory process (inclusive of environmental, aesthetic, program, civic, cultural, health and economic indicators)<br /> <br /> 3. Analyzing and measuring presence of justice and injustice in a local neighborhood using the Just City metric framework<br /> <br /></p>"

Methods for Medtn & Intrctn,"The course will approach concepts and methods for mediation and interaction from the perspective of the counterfactual framework. The first part of the course will be concerned with mediation analysis, that is assessing the extent to which the effect of an exposure on some outcome is mediated through a particular intermediate and the extent to which it is direct or through other pathways. Definitions, theoretical identification results and statistical techniques related to mediation analysis will be covered. The material in this part of the course will clarify the assumptions required for the estimation of direct and indirect effect and will extend the approach to mediation typically employed in epidemiology and the social sciences to settings with interactions, non-linearities and time-varying exposures. The second part of the course will cover concepts and methods for interaction. Conceptual issues concerning interaction, effect modification and the relation and non-correspondence of statistical and mechanistic notions of interaction will be discussed. Empirical tests for biologic synergism and genetic epistasis will be discussed along with practical methods to implement such tests. Attention will be given to power and sample size calculations for interaction analyses and to assessing interaction in a variety of study designs including cohort, case-control, case-only, family-based and GWAS designs. If time permits, the course will conclude by offering an introduction to casual inference methods for addressing problems of social interaction, interference and spillover effects which arise in settings in which the exposure of one individual may affect the outcomes of other individuals. Prerequisites can be waived at the instructor's discretion. Course Prerequisite(s): EPI289 or EPI207 or BIO291"

Statistical Computing and Simulation-Based Analysis,"(New course.) This course teaches a synergetic blend of statistical computing and re-sampling (permutation and bootstrap) methods. Statistical computing allows more nuanced investigation of data, from appropriate visualizations and summarizations to analyses that are tailored to specific circumstances. Re-sampling methods can often allow for principled data analysis in circumstances where, for example, the parametric assumptions behind more traditional analyses are held in doubt or the estimands and estimators of interest are too complex for theoretical approximations. They can also be useful with small sample sizes where asymptotic theory is unlikely to hold. This course extensively uses R, a widely adopted statistical computing platform, to analyze a variety of data genres that one might face. The course will use case studies and projects to give students hands-on experience. This is an applied course in that the goal is to learn contemporary methods that can immediately be applied to one?s own research."

Field Trip to Brazil,"Brazil is the 6th largest country by area and has the largest population in Latin America. Although Brazil is the 8th largest economy globally, it has one of the highest levels of income inequality, which has a significant impact in public health. Infectious diseases remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality in Brazil. In this field trip to Brazil, students will learn about several infectious diseases that are endemic in Brazil and the biological, environmental and socioeconomic factors associated with their persistence and distribution. Approximately 15 Brazilian students will also participate in the course. Professors from Harvard and from Brazil will lecture and lead discussions. Lectures will be in English. The David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies at Harvard University, which has an office in SÃ£o Paulo, will facilitate work with Brazilian colleagues and institutions and assist with logistical arrangements. Lectures and discussions during the first week will focus on selected infectious diseases as well as social determinants of health, health policy in Brazil, and data sources and analysis. Students will also meet with researchers, public health workers and visit health care facilities. During the second week students will work in small teams to develop proposals. The group projects will require a broad approach that takes into account the biological, geoclimatic, social, economic, cultural, political, and demographic factors associated with the disease. At the end of the course students will present and discuss the results of their project with the entire class. Throughout this course the student will have an opportunity to interact with faculty from Harvard as well as faculty, public health workers, researchers, and students from Brazil."
Field Exp Health & Human Rghts,"In this course, students will acquire the basic skills in applying a human rights framework to health issues in a professional work environment. Depending on their field placement, they may learn about operational skills in settings where health and human rights are practiced or about organizing a study to investigate human rights conditions affecting health. Each student will be expected, in consultation with the instructor, to identify an organization engaged in relevant work for the Winter Session period and secure a placement within that organization. Students are expected to attend a short preparatory workshop in the Fall 2 quarter. Participants will study materials pertinent to their placement and project before heading to the field assignment. After completion of their field work, each student is required to hand in a 10-page paper to be graded by the course instructor on a pass/fail basis. Course Note: Contract with department required; attend a short workshop in Fall 2."
Systems Sci in Pub Health,"Obesity and chronic â  non-communicableâ   diseases present complex problems not easily solved by working in single disciplines, whether they focus on cells, individuals, or populations. They result from multi-directional interactions among several levels of environmental influences along with biological susceptibility. These interactions may change across periods of the life course and they may feed on each other to maintain high rates of morbidity. Systems science approaches such as agent-based modeling, system dynamics, and network analysis are potentially powerful tools to identify the most potent modifiable etiologic factors and most efficient levers for implementation of interventions. This one-week Winter Session course is designed to introduce students to these disciplines, which are being imported into public health from engineering, management, evolutionary and systems biology, and social sciences. At the end of the course, students should be sufficiently conversant in the principles and methods to read the applicable literature and collaborate with computational modelers. Specialized software is required for the course."
Hlth of Urban Pops in Colombia,"This course will pair students with Colombian students of public health to study the health effects from four components of a progressive social development model that integrates the peri-urban internally displaced populations in Medellin. Colombia is currently transitioning from a prolonged period of conflict and integrating the displaced population through initiatives in education, economics, transportation, and urban design impacts the health delivery system and ultimately this populationâ  s health. The course will be in a seminar format that provides students with in-depth interviews and discussion sessions with high and mid-level policy makers and local implementing partners of the four components of the model, as well as those involved in peace and diplomacy efforts, and those whose disciplines (econometrics, urban design, social and behavioral sciences) engage population health. Students will develop a widely-disseminated series of white papers that would engage policy-makers from not only local and national US and Colombian governments, but those from multi-lateral institutions working on issues of post-conflict displaced population health. The series would focus on each of these four areas and propose ongoing research and policy agendas. The course will contribute to the development of emerging student leaders in Medicine and Public Health as key players in post-conflict time periods for displaced populations by learning from local leaders in governmental and non-governmental organizations."
Hlth Sys Reform China Fld Stdy,"Ever since publication of the 2000 World Health Development Report, there has been an increasing global interest in the critical role played by health systems in improving efficiency, equity, and quality of health care, and in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). How health systems cope with the significant economic downturn is an important challenge facing many countries. This course introduces students to the basic methods for conducting health system analysis, sensitizes the participants on the global debate on health system reforms, and help the students gain some hands-on experiences by interacting with the major stake-holders in China. China represents an interesting country for conducting the field study on health system reforms, not only because it is the world's largest country and has a wide spectrum of health and health system issues, but also because China is at a critical stage of implementing new rounds of reforms. Students will be divided into theme groups. At the end of the trip, each group will submit a research paper (about 20 pages), analyzing a particular issue facing China's health system and proposing solutions. Each group will present and discuss the results of their diagnosis at one of the last days of the course in China, commented by invited policy experts and policy makers. The program will require a minimum of eight students, with a maximum enrollment of fifteen."
Global Cancer Epidemiology,"This course provides students an introduction to the global epidemiology of cancer as a tool to understand the worldwide pattern of cancer, the main risk factors operating in different regions, and the main approaches for cancer prevention and control.

EPI Methods Patient Safety & Q,"This course aims to prepare the student to design and conduct analyses of individual incidents and other n-of-1 studies, statistical process control and time series, designed delays in quality improvements, case-crossover studies and self-controlled case series. A case study will help to integrate topics: Surgical Quality Outcome Reports -- low-cost evaluation and spread of a quality improvement program. Patient safety officers are needed in every healthcare facility, and these people need basic skills in epidemiologic methods. Students in this course will be equipped to be facilitators of collaborative self-instruction in epidemiologic methods suited for local investigations, as well as to be competitive researchers who conduct crossover studies. They will acquire skills to evaluate studies by other people constructively while being emotionally supportive. While comparisons among individual patients, practitioners and institutions are influential in patient safety epidemiology, the primary emphasis is on improvements: changes in outcomes over time. This involves a slight shift in paradigms from traditional emphasis in epidemiology on between-person comparisons in cohort and case-control studies to within-person comparisons, as in crossover experiments and case-crossover studies."
BIO & EPI of Antibiotic Resist,"This course will cover concepts and issues in bacterial antibiotic resistance relevant to epidemiologic research in this field. The student will obtain understanding of the significance of the problem, the biology and mechanism of antibiotic resistance, risk factors for spread and measures to prevent this emerging problem.

Gbl Hlth Sys Gov Ch & Inst Inv,"Public health challenges - for example, pandemic flue, HIV/AIDS, obesity, neglected diseases, tobacco use, environmental degradation, and underperforming health systems â   increasingly shape and are shaped by the political, economic, and social aspects of globalization. Outbreaks of new infectious diseases such as SARS or pandemic flu can wreak immediate economic havoc on a regional or global scale. Neglected diseases, such as sleeping sickness or dengue fever, continue to cause immense human suffering. Meanwhile, international rules that fall outside the traditional health sphere â   such as those governing intellectual property, agriculture, human migration, and greenhouse gas emissions â   can have profound impacts on human health. While strong national health systems are critical for meeting population needs, the effects of and capacities to respond to a particular health threat often lie outside the control of any one nation state and outside the health sector. This course is intended to equip students with a basic introduction to major public health challenges, focusing on those that transcend national boundaries, and key related questions in global governance. Students will gain an understanding of the current functioning of the global health system and its shortcomings, and exposure to new approaches to addressing global public health challenges. Teaching methods in this intensive seven-week session include lectures, case studies, analytic writing, teamwork, and class discussion and debate. Students completing this course will gain knowledge and skills needed to: * Identify major global health challenges and key features of the current global health system * Describe the necessary functions of an effective global health system * Diagnose major governance gaps in the current system Evaluate a wide range of tools and mechanisms for shaping global governance processes <ul> <li>Analyze threats and opportunities for health outside the health sector</li> <li>Examine, asses and design interventions for improved governance</li> </ul> Course note: -listed at HKS as IGA-490M"
Gbl Hlth Sys Gov Ch & Inst Inv,"Public health challenges - for example, pandemic flu, HIV/AIDS, obesity, neglected diseases, or tobacco use - increasingly shape and are shaped by the political, economic, and social aspects of globalization. Outbreaks of new infectious diseases, such as SARS or H1N1 flu, can wreak immediate economic havoc on a regional or global scale. Neglected diseases, such as sleeping sickness, continue to cause immense human suffering. Meanwhile, international rules that fall outside the traditional health sphere - such as those governing intellectual property, trade in agriculture, human migration, and greenhouse gas emissions - can have profound impacts on human health. While strong national health systems are critical for meeting the needs of their populations, the effects of and capacities to respond to a particular health threat often lie outside the control of any one nation state. How suitable are existing international/global and national institutions for responding effectively and equitably to such challenges? What functions must the 'global health system' achieve? Where are the major governance gaps? What institutional innovations have succeeded? And how can we improve our collective capacity to respond to the increasingly complex nature of global health challenges? Through an intensive half-semester module, this course is intended to equip students with an analytic approach to answering these questions through: a basic introduction to major public health challenges and key questions in global governance; an understanding of the current functioning of the global health system and its shortcomings; and exposure to new approaches to addressing global public health challenges. The course will include case studies of innovative governance arrangements such as: the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control; the revised International Health Regulations; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; and product development partnerships for drug development, among others. The course is expected to be of particular interest to students of public health and public policy, but is open to all graduate students across the University. Also offered by the School of Public Health as GHP 548."
